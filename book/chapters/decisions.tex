\chapter[Second Friend: Decisions]{Decisions}

The next thing that you can do is make decisions between alternatives.
Conditional logic in your programs simulates decision-making. The common way to
decide what to do in JavaScrConditionalsipt is to use an if-statement.
If-statements will be your second friend! Along the way, we'll meet new data
types, including one that allows us to group multiple variables together.

\section{Truthiness}
When deciding between two options---should we go to the beach or stay
inside?---we use some criterion to push us to one side or the other---It's hot
out, let's go to the beach. We can phrase the process in terms of asking a
question and responding with a context-appropriate answer:

Is it hot out?
Yes, let's go to the beach.
No, let's stay inside.

In JavaScript we use the \textsf{Boolean} data type to simulate the answers yes
and no. Because \textsf{Boolean} is a data type it has two parts: a collection
of values, and a collection of operators that operate on those values. Unlike
\textsf{Number} values, there aren't that many distinct \textsf{Boolean} values.
In fact, there are only two. They are the literal values \texttt{true} and
\texttt{false}. Don't let the fact that there are only two of them fool you.
They are immensely powerful and can be combined in very complicated and useful
ways. Let's see how.

\begin{question}
  Find and fix the bug in the following line of code.
  \begin{lstlisting}
    let true;
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{question}

There are three built-in operators that transform \textsf{Boolean} values into
other \textsf{Boolean} values. They are named logical \textsf{not}, logical
\textsf{and}, and logical \textsf{or}. They let you model answers to compound
questions. It's easy to get caught up in logic puzzles and every single
programmer gets it backwards at some point. But at their core, \textsf{Boolean}
expressions involving the so-called logical operators are just answers to
questions. And you know how to answer questions. Don't let the foreign
programming language syntax make you forget that.

Let's start with the simplest transformer logical \textsf{not}. In JavaScript,
the explaination point (\texttt{!})---sometimes pronounced ``bang!'' in
programming circles---is used to notate logical \textsf{not} in code. It takes
one \textsf{Boolean} input and transforms it into one \textsf{Boolean} output.
To describe logical \textsf{not} fully, we can draw its fundamental diagram all
of its inputs, i.e., twice: once with the input \texttt{true}, and again with
the input \texttt{false}.

\begin{figure}
  \input{book/figures/conditionals/not-true-fundamental-diagram.tex}\\
  \input{book/figures/conditionals/not-false-fundamental-diagram.tex}
\caption{\label{conds:not-fundamental-diagram.tex}The fundamental diagrams for
logical \textsf{not} applied to each input.}
\end{figure}

Now you (technically) know everything there is to know about the function
logical \textsf{not}. When the input is \texttt{true}, the output \textsf{not}
\texttt{true} evaluates to the value \texttt{false}. Likewise, when the input is
\texttt{false}, the output \textsf{not} \texttt{false} evaluates to
\texttt{true}. Logical \textsf{not} flips Boolean values between \texttt{true}
and \texttt{false}.

It is somewhat cumbersome to write out the fundamental diagram for each input
value to a function. For functions that operate on a small number of inputs,
such as these \textsf{Boolean} operators, it is convenient to collect the inputs
and outputs into a table, with one column for each input and another column for
an expression of function applied to the inputs, and a final column for the
evaluation of the expression.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{c  c  c}
    x & !x & !x\\
    \textsf{Input} & \textsf{Application} & \textsf{Evaluation}\\
    \hline
    true & !true & false\\
    false & !false & true
  \end{tabular}
\caption{\label{fig:conditionals-logical-not} The truth table for the function
logical \textsf{not}.}
\end{figure}

You can create such a table for any function. But when you create this kind of
table for combinations of \textsf{Boolean} functions, it gets a special name: a
\emph{truth table}. It is extremely easy to get confused when working through
the value of a \textsf{Boolean} expression. Even very experienced programmers
will get tripped out.\marginnote{Always write things down. Don't try to
calculate in your head. You don't get bonus points for doing it in your head.}
Truth tables are extremely helpful at making the logic of an expression plain,
especially once we start combining operators to make more complicated
expressions.

\begin{question}
Write the pipeline fundamental diagram of the function double \textsf{not}
(\texttt{!!}); that is, the function of \textsf{not} applied to the output of
\textsf{not}.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Write the truth table for double \textsf{not} (\texttt{!!}). \textsc{Hint:} For
any input \texttt{x}, \texttt{!!x} evaluate to the same value as \texttt{!(!x)};
that is, the value of \textsf{not} applied to the output of \textsf{not}.
\end{question}

When calculating the value of a boolean expression is very, very helpful to
break it down into as many subexpressions as possible. As an example, let's
construct the truth table for triple \textsf{not} (\texttt{!!!}). We'd like to
be able to write down the answer straight away, but that involves a lot of
intermediate calculations. If we tried to keep track of things in our head, it'd
be easy to lose track of how many times we've applied \textsf{not}. So, let's
expand our table to include all of the intermediate calculations.
\marginnote{When working on pipelines with big data, saving intermediate steps
becomes even more critical. If the pipeline fails after running for days on a
large data set, you'll be happy that you saved intermediate steps instead of
starting over at the beginning. Your boss will be happy that you did, too.} It
is good and be explicit and write down all of the steps.

Let's make a dummy variable \texttt{x} to be in the input of our expression. In
one row, \texttt{x} will be assigned the value \texttt{true}. In the other,
\texttt{x} will be assigned the value \texttt{false}. We want to know what the
output value \texttt{!!!x} evaluates to. In order to calculate \texttt{!!!x}, we
first need to calculate \texttt{!!x}. But to calculate \texttt{!!x}, we first
need to calculate \texttt{!x}. But we know how to calculate \texttt{!x}. Let's
go!

\begin{figure*}[h]

\textsf{Application} & \textsf{Evaluation} & \textsf{Application} &
\textsf{Evaluation}\\
    \hline
    true & !true & false & !false & true & !true & false\\
    false & !false & true & !true & false & !false & true
  \end{tabular}

\textsf{not}, with intermediate calculations for subexpressions.}
\end{figure*}

Logical \textsf{not} produces a single \textsf{Boolean} output. When we
repeatedly apply \textsf{not}, we can temporarily forget about that all of the
other \textsf{not}s to come and focus on the inputs and outputs one at a time.
In general, to evaluate an expression (of any kind), we evaluate the nearest
function on its input and work to the outside, providing the output of one
function as the input to the next. While we could draw a fundamental diagram
each time we supply outputs as inputs, we often use parentheses to signify the
inputs. Below we've written out the top row of the truth table for
triple-\textsf{not} with parentheses to point out which step we're working on.
After each applicaion of \textsf{not}, the expression reduces to a simpler one.
Then we pass on the output to the next copy of \textsf{not} for evaluation. Each
time, moving the parentheses over by one place to capture the next function
application. This process of grouping inputs and moving to the next function
will work for all expressions, not just \textsf{Boolean} expressions. And we
will use this technique widely for the rest of programming for all time.

Logical \textsf{not} takes only on input. The other two \textsf{Boolean}
functions, logical \textsf{or} and logical \textsf{and}, operate on two inputs.

\texttt{true} and \texttt{b} is \texttt{true}. You can visualize it as the
instances where \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} coincide.}
